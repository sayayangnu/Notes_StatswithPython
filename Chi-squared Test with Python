Conducting Chi-sqaured test with Scipy

"""
First let's look at one category test 
"""

#conducting chi-square test between observed and expected; one -variable 
from scipy.stats import chisquare
import numpy as np
observed=[27816,3124,1039,311,271,32561]
expected=[26146.5,3939.9,944.3,260.5,1269.8,32561]
race_pvalue=chisquare_value,pvalue=chisquare(observed,expected)
#if p value > p critial, reject H0, i.e.  the result is significnant


"""
Second, chi square test with multiple categories
Notice that the expected value is calculated by python
for example, talbe below for observed table 
    female male total
 A   5     10   15
 B   8     7    15
     13    17   30
 Then the expected value for female- A should be :
 13 * (15/30)= 13*0.5=6.5
 """

#conducting chi-sqaure test; multiple variables
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
observed = np.array([[5, 5], [10, 10]])
chisq_value, pvalue, df, expected = chi2_contingency(observed)

#if given a large table and need to count the frequence of each categories myself; can use the pandas crosstab function
import pandas
table = pandas.crosstab(income['sex'],[income['race']])
print(table)
#this will give a table with row splitted by male, female; and col of different races; value= frequency
